Electric Vehicle (EV) Smart Charging
---------------------------------------
The Electric Vehicle Smart Charging case study considers the smart charging of EVs within an unbalanced three-phase distribution network.
The case study considers a business park where 80 EVs are charged at 6.6 kW charge points.
The objective is to charge all of the vehicles to their maximum energy level prior to departure, at lowest cost.

Flexible Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) Demand Side Response (DSR)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The building energy management case study focuses on a building with a flexible HVAC unit which is controlled in order to minimise costs,
with the constraint that the internal temperature remains between 16\ :sup:`o`\ C and 18\ :sup:`o`\ C.
