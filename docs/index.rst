Open Platform for Energy Networks (OPEN)
==========================================

OPEN provides a toolset for modelling, simulation and optimisation of smart local energy systems. The platform combines distributed energy resource modelling (e.g. for PV generation sources, battery energy storage systems, electric vehicles), energy market modelling, power flow simulation and multi-period optimisation for scheduling flexible energy resources.

The OPEN code is available on GitHub `here <https://github.com/EPGOxford/OPEN/>`_.
